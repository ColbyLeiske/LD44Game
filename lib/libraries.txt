Chrono - https://github.com/adnzzzzZ/chrono
    An enhanced version of the hump.timer library. Includes tags for timer repeats and cancelation

Boipushy - https://github.com/adnzzzzZ/boipushy
    Better input handling in Love2D. Bind keys to actions, and check action events to provide a layer of abstraction to our input methods. Also removes the need for keypressed and keyreleased functions.
    PLEASE go through this README to understand how the input works. We are NOT using keypressed and keyreleased. 

Classic - https://github.com/rxi/classic
    OOP implementation in Lua. Built by RXI so that is why we are using. Slightly paying homage to the boy.

Lume - https://github.com/rxi/lume
    Also built by RXI. Useful functions in lua with a focus towards game development. 
    In particular, take a peak at ripairs , randomchoice , weightedchoice , push , remove , shuffle , each , etc. PLEASE read through the README and understand what is there. These are huge.

Hump - https://hump.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
    Large set of utilities made to increase development speed and workflow. We are using Gamestates in partically, and potentially the camera if we don't roll our own. 
    Do NOT use hump.class - the flow with Classic is lightyears better in my opinion.
