# LD44 Game

---

## Note
This was written super fast with a two developers learning how to code / write games while doing this. The code is super ugly, but we got a really fun product out of it so I can't complain. I (Colby) thought about making this private because it didn't look pretty, but I think it shows we were really excited to do this no matter what. Thanks!

## What is Ludum Dare?
Ludum dare is a Game Programming Jam hosted twice a year where participants get 48 / 72 hours to create a game from scratch. 

## Our Game
The theme of ludum dare this time around is 'Your life is currency'. We aren't fans of this theme, but we wanted to give it a go regardless. Initially we wanted to make a moonlighter / binding of isaac style game. Room based , top-down(ish) and fight.
The scope of that was a little large and some of the team members are inexperienced with developing games, so we opted to develop something easier that we knew we could get done. With that, our Tetris clone was born.

## Tetris vs. Ours
We wanted to incorporate the theme into tetris and put a little spin on the classic game. We thought about the ways tetris has 'lives' , and you lose your life when you reach the top of the screen. We wanted to add an extra element to this and include a timer and if it reaches 0 , you also lose. You can gain time by clearing lines, gaining more if you clear a tetris, and in exchange for the time you receive, you can purchase blocks with your time. This can lead to higher combos, tetris's, and a little bit of extra gameplay.

Careful, when you buy a tetrimino, it replaces the next tetrimino in the queue!
